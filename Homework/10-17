## Homework 1

Discuss in your teams what a decentralized version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider
- What are the essential pieces of functionality?
- How would people cheat?
- How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design.

1. What are the essential pieces of functionality?
- VRF for randomizing the dice roll
- Smart contract for the game and rules
- Smart contract wallets for users to set limits and make it easier for a pick up game without having to write down a private key for a new wallet
- NFTs for properties
- ERC20 tokens for money

1. How would people cheat?
- People could cheat pretty much the same way they would in person. Try to take extra money from the bank, misrepresent the number rolled by the dice, stealing properties from others, not willing to play by the set rules of the game.

1. How could you prevent them from cheating?
- VRF: make sure the roll is truly random
- Smart contract for the game and rules: make sure the rules are set ahead of time so most of the cheating is eliminated.
- Smart contract wallets: make sure that user funds aren't stolen from a misplaced private key or seed phrase
- NFTs for properties: prove ownership of who hold what property
- ERC20 tokens for money: tranparent to see who has how much money and where it came from.
